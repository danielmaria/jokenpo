# Jokenpo Game

This is a simple Jokenpo game that runs in the browser. I created this project to practice CSS and enhance my frontend development skills.

## Rules
Jokenpo is a hand game played between two players. The game has three possible outcomes: rock, paper, or scissors. The rules are as follows:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beats paper.
- Paper beats rock.

To play the game, each player simultaneously chooses one of the three options. The winner is determined by comparing the choices according to the rules mentioned above.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript in Angular. It leverages CSS for styling the game interface and JavaScript for implementing the game logic.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Select your choice of rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on the respective button.
3. The computer will also make its choice.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or it was a tie.
5. Play again by selecting a new option or refresh the page to start a new game.

Have fun playing Jokenpo!
